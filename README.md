# Data Preprocessing Toolbox

Welcome to the Data Preprocessing Toolbox! This repository is a work in progress (WIP) and serves as a collection of tools for data preprocessing, including scrapers and code for handling image data, particularly DCM (DICOM) files. The aim is to streamline and automate the preprocessing pipeline, making it easier to work with large datasets of images.

## Introduction

The Data Preprocessing Toolbox is designed to help data scientists and researchers preprocess image data efficiently. Whether you are working with medical images in DCM format or other types of images, this toolbox provides the necessary tools to clean, organize, and prepare your data for further analysis.

## Features

- **Scrapers**: Tools to scrape image data from various sources.
- **DCM Handling**: Functions to read, process, and convert DCM (DICOM) files.
- **Filesystem Operations**: Utilities to manage and organize image files in the filesystem.
- **Data Cleaning**: Methods to clean and standardize image data.
- **Batch Processing**: Scripts to process large batches of images efficiently.
